Redaxo multiple upload utility (rex_multiupload)
=========

Redaxo &quot;Multiupload&quot; AddOn

How to install:
Download the package, _rename the folder to **"rex_multiupload"**_ (without quotes) and upload it into your REDAXO AddOn dir.
It is important to rename, otherwise this addon won't work.

--

New in this version: realtime edit with ajax. After the upload has finished, you're able to modify any metainfo.
Change title, description or any other kind of metainfo. You can also delete a file immediately.

Notes:
- multiupload will now remember last synced cat (behaves like you already know from redaxo)
- improved layout and css
- mediapool-page is now update-stable (uses EP to inject the page, no patching-file required anymore)
- and a lot more.... have fun!!
